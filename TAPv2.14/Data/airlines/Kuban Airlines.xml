  Moscow Vnukovo. Near the end some of its routes were from KRR to Moscow Vnukovo,St. Petersburg,Sochi,Anapa and international ones to Istanbul,Turkey Yerevan,Armenia and Tel Aviv,Israel, on a scheduled basis.
  Seasonal routes included Larnaca,Cyprus Antalya,Turkey and Sharm el Sheikh,Egypt. Other scheduled domestic routes were Moscow Vnukovo to Chelyabinsk,Kaliningrad and Nalchik and from St. Petersburg it served
