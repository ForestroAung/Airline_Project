  <narrative narrative="Djibouti Air was only in operation from March 3,2011 to February 2012. Its only route was from Djibouti to Dubai,UAE. That is about a 2,000km flight. Its only plane was a 737-200 Adv. which had 2 classes. The bird in its logo is a Djibouti francolin, which can only be found in a small portion of the already small country of Djibouti, and it is
  very endangered." />
