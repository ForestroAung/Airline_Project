  <narrative narrative="Aserca Airlines is based at Valencia,Venezuela with another hub at Caracas. Its name means Aero Servicios Carabobo. At March 2015 it was serving 8 domestic destinations from Caracas and one to Aruba. From Valencia it was serving four domestic routes. At October 2014 its fleet was made of five MD-83's and four MD-82's. It had about 17 DC-9-30's up until recently when the government started forcing the airline of the country to get newer planes. The airline was founded in 1968 but did not start a very long time later in 1991. It served Bogota,Colombia Lima,Peru and Miami,FL,USA at one time also."/>
