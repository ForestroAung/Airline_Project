  <narrative narrative="VLM Airlines started operations in May 1993 with a scheduled service between Antwerp International Airport and London City Airport. 'VLM' is an abbreviation of Vlaamse Luchttransport Maatschappij, 'Flemish Air Transport Company'. Its original hub was Antwerp; this was switched to London City, and after a management buy-out late in 2014, it was again based at Antwerp Airport." />
