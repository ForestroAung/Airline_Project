  <narrative narrative="Air Rum was a Sierra Leon registered airline that actually made its base at Amman,Jordan. It started in 2002 and lasted until 2008. It was a charter airline flying around the world. A notable incident is when it was flying Gambian football/soccer fans to Peru for the 2005 FIFA U-17 Worls Championships and made an emergency landing
  in the city they were to play at lying about fuel starvation to let the fans off. It used Lockheed Tristars only, it started in 2002 with one L-1011-1 type and had three by 2006, but then didn't have any bu the start of 2007. The plane it aquried in 2004 was a 200 type and it had this until the end. It was banned from flying to the EU.The owner, RUM Group
  shut it down to focus on its other Amman based airline which did scheduled and charter, Petra Airlines, which was much more successful. Petra was bought 49% by Air Arabia in December 2014 and turned into Air Arabia Jordan, with RUM owning the other 51% still."/>
