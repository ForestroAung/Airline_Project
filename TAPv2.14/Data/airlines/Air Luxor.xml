  <narrative narrative="Air Luxor was an airline based at Lisbon,Portugal. It was founded in 1988 after the Mirpuri family decided to make their private fleet availible to the public. In 1997 it entered commercial
  aviation starting charters and in 2001 it started scheduled service as well. At closing it was serving the domestic airport at Funchal on Madeira Island,Paris Orly and Sao Tome. It had six A320-200's and one or two
  A330-300's at the end. From 200 to 2004 it used two Lockheed L-1011's. Other planes it used for short times were an A330-200,an A319-100,an A321-200,and a 767-200. The airline stopped flying in May 2006
  and was sold in July. The Mirpuri family started a new company called Hi Fly the same year and one of the A330's was transferred to it. Hi Fly is still in business as a charter airline as of June 2015. Air Luxor's name
  comes from the Luxor Plaza in Lisbon where its headquarters were."/>
