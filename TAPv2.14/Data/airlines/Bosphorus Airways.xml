  <narrative narrative="Bosphorus Airways was only around from 1992 to 1993, it was a charter airline from Turkey. It used two 737-300's and two 727's. It had planned on using DC-10's before it ceased. One of the causes of the airline closing was effects of the Second Gulf War. A 737 also got impounded a short time for violating embargos on flight into Serbia."/>
