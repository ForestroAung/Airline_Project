  <narrative narrative="Syphax Airlines was based at Sfax,Tunisia and had a secondary hub at Tunis. It was founded in 2011 and served 4 domestic airports,4 in France,3 in the UK,3 in Libya,New York City,
  Istanbul,Casablanca,Ljubljana in Slovenia,Zagreb in Croatia, Montreal in Canada and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia as of 2014.  At the end it had two A319's, and at one time a A330-200. It had four A320neo's on order  starting in January 2013 and was the first African airline to have ordered the type.
  However this order was cancelled in the summer of 2015 for financial problems. These financial problems led to the suspension of service in July 2015. The airline said they were looking for new funding to start again but this hasn't happened as of June 2016."/>
