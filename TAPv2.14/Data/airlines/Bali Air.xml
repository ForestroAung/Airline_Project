  <narrative narrative="Bali Air was around from 1973 to 2006. It was a subsidiary of Bouraq Indonesia Airlines its whole life, except its last year after Bouraq ceased operation in 2005. Bouraq had started in 1970.
  Bali Air made its base at Jakarta on the island of Java and not on the island of Bali at Denpensar like its name may suggest. It did operate there however. It operated at 8 domestic airports, at least near the end.
  It's fleet at the end was four 737-200's and four Hawker 748's." />
