It also flew to Caticlan,Busuanga,Bagabag,Catarman,Basco,El Nido and Cuyo. It was the first airline to introduce service to Caticlan and Busuanga. It used Beechcraft 1900C's most of its life, having 2 or 3 at the end. In 1989 the government had named it the second flag carrier after Philippine Airlines. Its competition with the PA prompted PA to use bigger planes than it had been at Dipolog,Kalibo and Tagbilaran, the Fokker 50 was what it started seding those places."/>
