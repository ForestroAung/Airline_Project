  <narrative narrative="Aeromar services began with a single Boeing 727 leased from Falcon Air for routes to Miami and San Juan. They expanded by purchasing a Boeing 747 to a new route to Madrid but the route was suspended 5 months later due to heavy competition with Iberia. In 2002 there was a new service to New York, and starting 2003 the airline began to fly to Aruba, Havana, and Caracas. They leased their Boeing 757 from Icelandair and 767 from Air Atlanta before ceasing operations. They were also the first airline to fly New York – Santiago, Dominican Republic starting in 2002." />
