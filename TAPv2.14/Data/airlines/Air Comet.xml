  Bogota and Medellin,Colombia Guayaquil and Quito,Ecuador Lima,Peru and Havana,Cuba. It did charters to the Caribbean from its hub and Palma de Mallorca most of its life from the start to January 2007 under the name Air Plus Comet. 
It then started full scheduled service. Its fleet at the end was four A330-200's, three A320-200's and two A340-300's. As Air Plus Comet it used around five A310's,a few 747-200's,a couple of 737-300's,and the two years before the brand switch two MD-88's.
