  Airlift International. To start in 1945 it flew Curtiss C-46 Commandos and DC-4's and had a main route to San Juan,Puerto Rico. In 1951 it expanded service to New York and soon after to Chicago and Detroit.
  In 1960 it got two DC-7's which did charters to Europe and for the military. It then got Armstrong Whitworth Argosy 660's but those were replaced by DC-8 jets in 1963. It also used L-1049 Super Constellations,Canadair
