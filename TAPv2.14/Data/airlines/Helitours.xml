It uses both normal planes and helicopters. It got its start in 1972. In the 1980's-2009 it didn't operate much due to the Sri Lankan civil war. The Air Force kept service to Jaffna but it wasn't considered part of Helitours. At May 2015 it serves about 7 other airports from RML, and it considers Hambantota a secondary hub. Its fixed wing fleet around 2013 was four Harbin Y-12's,two Xian MA60's and one Antonov 32.
