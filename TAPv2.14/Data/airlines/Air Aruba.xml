  <narrative narrative="Air Aruba was the flag carrier of the island nation belonging to the Kingdom of the Netherlands from 1988 to late 2000. It began in 1986 as a ground handling agent and two years  later 
  started flying to the other Netherlands Antilles islands of Curcao and Bonaire and Caracas,Venezuela. It used three Japanese NAMC YS-11's for this. In 1990 it got a 757-200 and began flying to Miami,FL,USA
  and started flying to places like Santo Domingo,Dominican Republic Newark,NJ,USA Sao Paulo,Brazil Saint Marteen Maracaibo,Venezuela and Las Piedras,Venezuela over the few years after founding. In 1991 or 1990
  it began leasing a 767-200 from Air Holland to fly to Amsterdam and Cologne,Germany. By 1995 it had stopped using the 757 type and by 1995 the 767 type of which it also had a 767-300 for a short time. It had a 737-300 for a short time
  from 1990 to 1992 also. Eventually it replaced the NAMC's with two Embraer 120 Brasilia's. In 1992 it got two MD-82's which it had until the end. It also got an MD-83 but stopped using it a few years later.
  In 1993 it got a Douglas DC-9-30 which it used until the end and in 1998 it got three MD-90's which it used until the end. Other places it served were Orlando,FL,USA Tampa,FL,USA Houston,TX,USA Baltimore,MD,USA
  Philadelphia,PA,USA Manaus,Brazil Barranquilla,Bogota,Cali and Medellin in Colombia and in Venezuela aside from places already mentioned it served Barcelona,Coro,Isla Margarita,and Valencia also. It also had one leased 727-100
  at one time. In 1998 Venezuelan airline Aserca bought a majority of the airline to help it through bankruptcy. But in 2000 it would do the same and this time cease operations. Ascera is still flying as of 2015 itself."/>
