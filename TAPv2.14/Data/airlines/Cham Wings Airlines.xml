  from 2008 to 2012 and flew its first flight to Baghdad,Iraq. It stopped in 2012 due to the Syrian Civil War piled on the fact it was struggling to make money as a charter airline because the
  government denied it permission to do scheduled service. In 2014 it gained approval to do scheduled service and began flying again in 2015. At mid 2016 it was serving all of its routes 
  from Damascus. The domestic ones are to Al-Qamishli and Latakia. The international ones are to Baghdad,Iraq Nejaf,Iraq Istanbul,Turkey Kuwait   Dubai,UAE Beirut,Lebanon Tehran,Iran Khartoum,Sudan and Muscat,Oman. Some routes were terminated
