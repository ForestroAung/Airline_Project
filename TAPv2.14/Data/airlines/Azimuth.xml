    <narrative narrative="Due to the merger of Donavia with Rossiya Airlines in 2016, Rostov-on-Don lost the main airline based at its airport, even though Rossiya continued the flights previously operated by Donavia. As Rostov-on-Don was selected as one of the host cities for the 2018 football world cup in Russia, there was a perceived need for another airline to provide extra flights. The airline received an air operator&apos;s certificate (AOC) in August 2017." />
