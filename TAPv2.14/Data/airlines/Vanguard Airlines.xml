  <narrative narrative="Vanguard Airlines was based at Kansas City,Missouri from 1994 to July 2002. It had a focus city at Chicago Midway. Outside of those 2 it served 26 other domestic airports in its life.
It was a low cost airline, having fares for around 29$ was normal, even as little as 10$ were seen sometimes. But by 2000 this model was not working as planned and it started switching to a low cost model which charge
more close to the major airlines. The airline declared bankruptcy and ceased on July 29,2002. It had been losing money with each ticket sold due to credit card processors requiring a 125% surety bond. Its fleet
at the end was six 737-200's,three MD-82's,two 727-200's,two MD-87's,an MD-83 and an MD-81. "/>
