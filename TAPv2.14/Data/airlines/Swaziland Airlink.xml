  <narrative narrative="Swaziland Airlink is a subsidiary of the South African airline Airlink. It is the flag carrier of Swaziland as of 2015 and the only route it does is Manzini-Johannesburg with an ERJ 135. Its hub recently changed since the old Manzini Matsapha Airport was taken over by the military and the new 
  King Mswati Airport opened in early 2014. The airline was founded in 1999 and is 60% owned by the government and 40% by Airlink. It had a Fokker F28 for the first year and a half and then a BAe Jetstream 41." />
