    <narrative narrative="Simrik Airlines was founded in 2009 as a helicopter charter company. The company still operates as such under the name Simrik Air, whereas the fixed-wing operations are promoted under the brand Simrik Airlines. In 2013, Simrik Airlines acquired the ill-fated Guna Airlines for NRs 350 million, after latter ceased trading due to financial difficulties. Simrik Airlines used the Brand of Guna for some more time before renaming and repainting its fleet." /></profile>
