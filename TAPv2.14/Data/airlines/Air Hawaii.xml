    <narrative narrative="Air Hawaii was a very short lived airline that flew from November 22,1985 to February 19,1986. It began the route from Honolulu to Los Angeles at the start and in December added
    San Francisco. It had one DC-10-10 at the start and on January 13th got another. The planes had been part of Michael Hartleys previous airline The Hawaii Express which was around from August 1982 to December 1983.
    Air Hawaii ceased due to financial problems it had from the start. Michael Hartley would go on to be a co founder of ticket website CheapTickets." />
