  <narrative narrative="Harlequin Air was a subsidiary of Japan Airlines that operated from 1997 to 2005 when it was absorbed into its parent. Its base was Fukuoka where it operated domestic
  flights to Nagoya's Centrair Airport and Sapporo's New Chitose Airport. It also did international charters. It operated at least two planes which were painted in its own livery, a DC-10-30 and an MD-81. It also used its parents
  planes painted in the Japan Airlines livery when needed." />
