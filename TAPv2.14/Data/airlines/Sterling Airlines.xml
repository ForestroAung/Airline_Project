    <narrative narrative="Sterling Airlines was a Danish airline based at Copenhagen from 1962 until October 29,2008 when it declared bankruptcy. It was founded as Sterling Airways and was a charter airline most of its life. It took the name Sterling European Airlines in 1994 and in 2005 Sterling Airlines. It started scheduled service in 2000 with routes to Malaga and Alicante,Spain. By the end of 2002 it had 21 scheduled routes. And in 2003 11 more. It served 1.3 millions passengers in 2003, a 40% increase from 2002. It treated Stockholm-Arlanda,Malmo,Gothenburg in Sweden as focus cities and Oslo Gardermoen in Norway as one as well as Billund in Denmark. Its first planes in 1963 were two DC-6B's. The next year it got more and in 1965 it got its firsy Sud Aviation Caravelle 10. In 1987 it had 19 planes and 1300 employees. In 1993 it went bankrupt and it started back up with the new Sterling European name in 1994. In 1996 the Norweigan shipping company Fred Olsen bought it. In 2005 its parent,now Fons Eignarhaldsfelag, an Icelandic investment company, bought Maersk Air, another Danish airline owned by the shipping company Maersk. It merged Maersk Air with Sterling and it became Sterling Airlines. It also made them the fourth largest low fare airline in Europe. After ceasing operations in October 2008 Cimber Air also of Denmark bought the landing slots,website and name of Sterling but no planes. Cimber Air adopted the name Cimber Sterling afterwards until 2012 when it too went bankrupt. That airline was refounded as part of SAS following that and is now just called Cimber A/S.
