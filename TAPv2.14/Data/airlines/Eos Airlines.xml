  <narrative narrative="Eos Airlines was around from operations start at October 18,2005 until April 27,2008. It was a business airline based at New York JFK. 
  The airline operated its Boeing 757s in a 48-seat all-business class configuration. The seats had a fold-out table and a seating arrangement that allowed passengers to sit face-to-face to hold business meetings or dine together.
  The only route it performed its whole life was from JFK to London Stansted,UK which is a route not being served at 2015. At the end it had five 757's and started with three. There were plans to open routes
  from JFK to Paris and between Newark and Dubai as well."/>
