    <narrative narrative="Aeris was an airline company based in Toulouse, France. It was founded in 1999 and was defunct in 2003 after being unable to raise additional capital.
Aeris could be viewed as a low-cost carrier. According to Aeris' marketing director A. Scherer, the aim was to lure business travellers from small-and-medium-sized companies away from the national giant. Perpignan was one of these battlegrounds, with Air France operating four daily round-trips from Paris, and Aeris three."/>
